How to downsample to 128 samples using Wavosaur

Example files:
C:\Users\perivar.nerseth\OneDrive\Audio\Soundfonts and other samples\Singe Cycle Waveforms\wavetables\analogwaveforms\minimoog

Process -> Resample: 
current samplerate (hz): 22050
change to (hz): 692 (i.e. the new sample rate)

Example:
minimoogtri.wav

change to sample rate 	= dest length * current samplerate / original length
						= 128 * 22050 / 4096
						= 689.0625 hz

						(strangely this always gives one sample to little)
