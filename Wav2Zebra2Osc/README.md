# Welcome to Wav2Zebra2Osc

**Question: What does this program do?**
> **Answer:** 
> 
>  - It converts audio files to sampled waveforms (aka wavetables) which can be used in the awsome u-he Zebra 2 Synthesizer. The tool converts up to 16 audio files (or an interpolation between one or more waveforms) into one wavetable preset. 

**Question: How do I do this?**
> **Answer:**
>  
> - You load waveforms into one or more cells (16 in total) either by doubleclicking on an wave cell or by using **"Load cell(s)"** from the File-menu.  You can load several waveforms at once. 
> - You can either see the "raw" (i.e. not-processed) waveform or you can see the waveform after it has been morphed.  
> (The imported audio files will always be downsampled to 128 bit).
> -Choose where you would want to save the sampled waveform and click **"Export to Zebra 2"**. 
- Once the file is in the right place you start Zebra2 and on the oscillators there's a small tab on the lower left that probably says default. Click that and a browser for oscillator presets comes up. Locate the exported file and click on it.  Voila you have a sampled waveform in Zebra2.

**Anything else?**

> - You can also generate a waveshape by rightclicking on a cell and select a waveshape you like, e.g. "Saw Rising" or "Triangle".

> - In addition you can play the waveshape and navigate using your arrow keys.
> - Drag and Drop onto cells also work.
